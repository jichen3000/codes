Tree-based regression

Tree-based regression
Pros: Fits complex, nonlinear data
Cons: Difficult to interpret results
Works with: Numeric values, nominal values

CART is a well-known and well-documented tree-building algorithm that makes binary splits and handles continuous variables.

Tree pruning, prevent from overfitting
    Postpruning

Piecewise linear means that you have a model that consists of multiple linear segments.
    The interpretability of model trees is one reason why youâ€™d choose them over regression trees. The second reason is higher accuracy.
