chapter 13. Using principal component analysis to simplify data
dimensionality reduction. 
principal component analysis (PCA). In PCA, the dataset is transformed from its original coordinate system to a new coordinate system.
Factor analysis is another method for dimensionality reduction. In factor analysis, we assume that some unobservable latent variables are generating the data we observe.
Another common method for dimensionality reduction is independent component analysis (ICA).

Principal component analysis
Pros: Reduces complexity of data, indentifies most important features Cons: May not be needed, could throw away useful information
Works with: Numerical values
