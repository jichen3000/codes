Efficiently finding frequent itemset with FP-growth

That task is finding frequent itemsets or pairs, sets of things that commonly occur together, by storing the dataset in a special structure called an FP-tree.  The FP stands for “frequent pattern.”
faster execution times than Apriori

The FP-growth algorithm scans the dataset only twice.
1. Build the FP-tree.
2. Mine frequent itemsets from the FP-tree.

FP-growth
Pros: Usually faster than Apriori.
Cons: Difficult to implement; certain datasets degrade the performance. Works with: Nominal values.

The FP-tree is used to store the frequency of occurrence for sets of items.

The header table will allow you to quickly access all of the elements of a given type in the FP-tree.
