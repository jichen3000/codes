chapter 14. Simplifying data with the singular value decomposition
singular value decomposition (SVD). It’s a powerful tool used to distill information in a number of applications, from bioinformatics to finance.

The singular value decomposition (SVD)
Pros: Simplifies data, removes noise, may improve algorithm results. Cons: Transformed data may be difficult to understand.
Works with: Numeric values.

The method that uses SVD is called latent semantic indexing (LSI) or latent semantic analysis.
